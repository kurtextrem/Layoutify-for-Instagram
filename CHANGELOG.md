# Changelog

## 3.2.0 - 2020-09-04

### Known Issues

On the 3-dots page, posts will show up two or three times instead of once. This is a bug that still puzzles me, but I'll continue trying to fix it.

### Changed

Instagram lawyer forced me to change the extension **icon**, possibly the name in the future. :(

### Bug Fixes

Since the last release with a changelog, there have been many releases containing just bug fixes. If you find any more, please write an email to me.

## 3.1.0 - 2020-04-09

### Changed

The "Pictures Only" setting has been updated (and fixed, it was broken from 3.0.0). Here's how it looks combined with "No Space Between Posts":

### Bug Fixes

This release contains all the bugfixes from 3.0.1 and 3.0.2:

- Fixed "posts on profiles could not be opened"
- On the main feed, the like button always did the opposite (_ouups, I'm only human after all... or maybe unintended april fools?_). Fixed.
- Fixed the "Load more" button on the 3-dots like/saved page
- Fixed the login screen (the new feed was on top of it)

**Thank you again for all the nice emails, bug reports and so on. This means a lot to me and helps me fix issues faster.**

### Upcoming

- Instagram DMs finally arrived on Desktop. This means the "Share" button is useful again, hence in this version you can see it again, when you view a single post. I will try to add the button to the main feed too.
- Also, the preview of stories in the main feed is missing, this is on my Todo list as well

## 3.0.0 - 2020-03-29

_Again, it has been quite some time since the latest bigger release (this excludes bug-fixes etc.)._

This version brings a long-term **fix for the scrolling issue** many people had in the past (including myself). To explain: Instagram changed the way the feed works and broke my method of having multiple posts per row.

The new feed is entirely written by me and even improves performance compared to Instagram. As a plus, compared to Instagrams feed, it **does not log user actions**, which is a nice **privacy bonus**!

It is still beta, however. If you find any issues, or missing features, let me know (email is on 3-dot page -> About)

**Thank you for all your continued support, even though I sometimes don't have much time to update the extension as I'm a full-time student. I also wish you, your family and your loved ones the best during the Corona crisis. ♥**

## 2.10.0 - 2019-08-28

The latest bigger release was in December, but don't worry, in the time between I have done a lot of bug fixes. Feedback welcome (email is on 3-dot page -> About) :)

Enjoy your summer!

## [2.8.0] - 2018-09-04

- Great feature: You can now view your different collections!

- "Saved" is now "Collections"

- **IMPORTANT**: I know, it doesn't look pretty and the names is the ID Instagram uses. However, my time is limited currently (exams) and thus I found it more important to release the feature instead of waiting until I decided on a good design.

  - How it works: You will get a notification whenever the User posts something, and/or adds a new Story

  - You can decide whether to get notified in background, or only if you open Instagram.com (latter is default)

  - The User(s) will have a badge on his profile, so you can recognize whom you are watching

- New Changelog page (can be accessed on the 3-dots page under "?")

  - It will open automatically, whenever something bigger has changed (so not when there's only bug fixes)
